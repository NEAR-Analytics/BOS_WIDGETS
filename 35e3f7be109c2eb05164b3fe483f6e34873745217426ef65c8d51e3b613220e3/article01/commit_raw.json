It operates on a technology called blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, Bitcoin is not controlled by any central authority, such as a central bank. Instead, it relies on a peer-to-peer network of computers to validate and verify transactions. This makes Bitcoin resistant to censorship and government interference.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Bitcoin transactions are secured using cryptographic algorithms. Users have a digital wallet that stores their Bitcoin addresses, which are used to send and receive funds. Transactions are verified by miners, who solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins for their efforts.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Bitcoin has gained popularity as a digital currency and a store of value. It is used for various purposes, including online purchases, remittances, and investment. Its decentralized nature and limited supply make it attractive to those seeking an alternative to traditional financial systems.\n    </p>\n    <h2>Example:</h2>\n    <p>\n      Let's say Alice wants to send 0.05 BTC to Bob. Alice initiates the transaction from her Bitcoin wallet by specifying Bob's Bitcoin address and the amount to send. The transaction is broadcasted to the network, where miners validate and include it in a block. Once confirmed, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain, and Bob's wallet reflects the new balance of 0.05 BTC.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n   <Switch.Thumb className=\"SwitchThumb\" />\n    </Switch.Root>\n  </Wrapper>\n);", "metadata": {"platform": "jutsu.ai"}, "branch": {"draft": null}, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/35e3f7be109c2eb05164b3fe483f6e34873745217426ef65c8d51e3b613220e3/widget/article01", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "14f37c0b285ee155302e6305dac2b1cd", "inserted_timestamp": "2023-11-04T23:30:40.962Z", "modified_timestamp": "2023-11-04T23:30:40.962Z", "__row_index": 0}
