The system checks prices between the oracle and the liquidity pool. If the price is good, the transaction is executed; otherwise, it's rejected.\n\n## Credits to Flare Network\nBefore Flare Network's FTSO, gas-efficient circuit breakers were challenging. In relation to our work on EIP-7265 and implementations on other networks, circuit breakers usually had significant gas implications. Flare's native on-chain price feeds resolve this issue, making circuit breakers a prominent use case that highlights the USPs of Flare.\n\n\nsponsored tech stacK:\n\n![DEX Image](/scaffold-eth/packages/nextjs/public/readme/sponsors.svg)\n", "image": {"ipfs_cid": "bafkreiay4fvzpvpzu4jcsof4fjc5bg3oump47uodufeijcqyzgejss7jgi"}, "linktree": {"website": "near.org/markeljan.near/widget/SwapGuard"}, "name": "SwapGuard", "tags": {"eth": "", "eth-london": "", "ethlondon": ""}}, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/markeljan.near/widget/SwapGuard", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "8216a28558e0de4207baddaf53c45658", "inserted_timestamp": "2023-10-29T15:40:42.751Z", "modified_timestamp": "2023-10-29T15:40:42.751Z", "__row_index": 0}
