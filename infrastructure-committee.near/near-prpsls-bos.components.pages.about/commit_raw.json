Not to rest on\n      any laurels, various leaders across the NEAR ecosystem devised the\n      Infrastructure Committee to quickly address these concerns with funding\n      and processes to get those funds distributed. These processes handle\n      sharing RFPs, submitting proposals, reviewing and voting on proposals, and\n      getting funds to teams when a proposal is approved. These directives and\n      processes form an initiative to build up resilient, fast, and redundant\n      infrastructure to meet the short-term and future needs of NEAR\u2019s thriving\n      ecosystem.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You can learn more about the Infrastructure Committee on the GitHub\n      <a\n        href=\"https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      >\n        Wiki\n      </a>\n      .

Towards this effort, the Committee will be\n      drafting several Requests For proposals that outline urgent or highly\n      desired projects. Partners current or new are encouraged to submit\n      proposals, either as a response to an RFP, or standalone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the process proceeds as follows:\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          The proposal is drafted. Working Group and Committee members are free\n          to review and offer suggestions.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, the proposal moves into\n          voting. The Committee can vote asynchronously between official\n          meetings but most business is conducted at bi-weekly meetings.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If your proposal is rejected, you will be informed by an IC or WG\n          member usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be\n          offered on the proposal on how to update the proposal for\n          resubmission.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline.\n          This will require you (or your company) to complete the KYC/B process\n          including ID Verify (a service) followed by a Legal working agreement,\n          and finally, a test transaction to ensure the target wallet address is\n          correct.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on\n          our{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            {\" \"}\n            Github repo\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          to be tracked on our{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Github project\n          </a>\n          .
