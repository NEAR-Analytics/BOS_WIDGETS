These processes handle sharing\n      RFPs, submitting proposals, reviewing and voting on proposals, and getting\n      funds to teams when a proposal is approved. This initiative will focus\n      funds on building resilient, fast, redundant infrastructure to meet NEAR's\n      thriving ecosystem's short-term and future needs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The GitHub Wiki provides information about the\n      <a\n        href=\"https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Committee\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      >\n        Infrastructure Committee (IC)\n      </a>{\" \"}\n      and the{\" \"}\n      <a\n        href=\"https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group/wiki/Infrastructure-Working-Group\"\n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      >\n        Working Group (WG)\n      </a>\n      , including current members.\n    </p>\n    <h4>Process Summary</h4>\n    <p>\n      The Committee actively seeks proposals from partners like you to enhance,\n      upgrade, and fortify NEAR ecosystem infrastructure. To this end, the\n      Committee will draft several Requests For Proposals (RFPs) that outline\n      urgent or highly desired projects. We encourage you to submit proposals as\n      a response to an RFP or standalone, as your contributions are crucial to\n      our collective success.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Generally, the process proceeds as follows;\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          The proposal is drafted. Working Group and Committee members are free\n          to review and offer suggestions.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Once everyone feels the proposal is ready, it moves to voting. The\n          committee votes asynchronously and in regular committee meetings. A\n          proposal is approved if it receives a majority vote from the Committee\n          members.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          In the event of a rejection, you will be informed by an IC or WG\n          member, usually via the Telegram group established. Guidance may be\n          offered on how to update the proposal for resubmission.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If your proposal is approved, you will move into the Funding Pipeline.\n          You (or your company) will complete the KYC/B process, which involves\n          providing your personal or company information for verification\n          purposes. Next will be a legal working agreement, and finally, a test\n          transaction will be conducted to ensure the target wallet address is\n          correct.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Project Management: we encourage awarded teams to create a project on\n          our{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/near/Infrastructure-Working-Group\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            {\" \"}\n            Github repo\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          where the community tracks progress on our{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/orgs/near/projects/133/views/6\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Github project\n          </a>\n          .
