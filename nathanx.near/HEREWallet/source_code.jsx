      <strong>What is HERE Wallet?</strong>
      <p>
        NEAR is a fast-growing ecosystem with over 20 million users. The main
        wallet for NEAR is the NEAR Wallet, but it is only available in web
        mode. Until a certain time, there was no convenient mobile wallet for
        NEAR. HERE Wallet focuses on the use of NEAR instead of storing it. You
        can stake, buy NEAR for BTC and other crypto and fiat, swap and more
        just in one app!
