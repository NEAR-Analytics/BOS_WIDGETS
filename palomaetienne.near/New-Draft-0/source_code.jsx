    Dao Ashe has applied for quadrantic funding. What is it? It is a
    crowd-funding mechanism that amplifies available resources by inviting
    community members to make donations (big or small) that act as votes on
    where to allocate funds. The broader the support, the bigger the match! We
    believe that DAO Ashe's mission to nurture diverse artists' self-expression
    on the blockchain, alongside offering a community for marginalized and
    isolated individuals, is aligned with unlocking the universal potential of
    blockchain technology. Through promoting inclusivity and community building,
    DAO Ashe contributes to the democratisation of access and fosters global
    collaboration within the blockchain ecosystem. This is the link to apply:
