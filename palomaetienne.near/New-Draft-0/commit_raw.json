What is it? It is a\r\n    crowd-funding mechanism that amplifies available resources by inviting\r\n    community members to make donations (big or small) that act as votes on\r\n    where to allocate funds. The broader the support, the bigger the match! We\r\n    believe that DAO Ashe's mission to nurture diverse artists' self-expression\r\n    on the blockchain, alongside offering a community for marginalized and\r\n    isolated individuals, is aligned with unlocking the universal potential of\r\n    blockchain technology. Through promoting inclusivity and community building,\r\n    DAO Ashe contributes to the democratisation of access and fosters global\r\n    collaboration within the blockchain ecosystem.
