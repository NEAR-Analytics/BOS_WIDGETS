It\n        eliminates the need for trust in a central authority by using a\n        transparent blockchain platform. Repute holds funds from the buyer and\n        collateral from the seller, ensuring both parties fulfill their\n        obligations. It provides a secure and reliable solution for trading\n        assets in special situations, such as bankruptcy claims, airdrop farming\n        addresses, and agreements related to unvested tokens.\n      </Detail>\n\n      <Name>How it works</Name>\n      <Detail>\n        Alice owns a bankruptcy claim worth $1,000, and she wants to sell it to\n        Bob for 10 cents on the dollar. Normally, transferring ownership of such\n        claims is complicated due to various legal rules and the involvement of\n        parties from different jurisdictions. To ensure a smooth transaction,\n        Alice and Bob turn to Repute. They engage the escrow service, which\n        operates on a decentralized blockchain platform. Repute holds the funds\n        that Bob will pay and requires Alice to deposit collateral as assurance.\n        Now, both Alice and Bob have a strong incentive to fulfill their\n        obligations. If either party backs out of the deal, the other party will\n        receive the deposited funds or collateral held by Repute. This\n        arrangement builds trust and ensures that the transaction proceeds as\n        agreed upon. With Repute's escrow service, the trade becomes secure and\n        reliable. The use of blockchain technology guarantees transparency, as\n        all transaction details are recorded immutably on the blockchain. This\n        eliminates the need for reliance on a centralized authority, making the\n        process more efficient and trustworthy. In this example, Repute\n        simplifies the trading of a bankruptcy claim by providing a\n        decentralized escrow service. It enables Alice and Bob to transact\n        securely and confidently, overcoming the complexities associated with\n        traditional methods of transferring such assets.\n      </Detail>\n\n      <Name3 href=\"/mishih.near/widget/ReputeOffers\">Get Started!</Name3>\n    </Header>\n  </Container>\n);\n", "metadata": null, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/mishih.near/widget/ReputeAbout", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "7f69c0a763795cb7dca14f1acf636c4a", "inserted_timestamp": "2024-03-07T05:24:05.087Z", "modified_timestamp": "2024-03-07T05:24:05.087Z", "__row_index": 0}
