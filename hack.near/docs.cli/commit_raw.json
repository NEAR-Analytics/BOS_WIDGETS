Components\n2. SocialDB\n\nKeep reading to learn about what is available in the CLI.\n\n\n### Components\n--> working with components (download, deploy, etc.)\n\n- 'deploy' allows you to upload/publish components from your local ./src folder to near.social account.\n- 'download' allows you to download the existing components from any near.social account to the local ./src folder.\n- 'delete' allows you to delete the existing components from any near.social account.\n\n### SocialDB\n##### Data Management:\n--> viewing, adding, updating, deleting information by a given key\n\n- 'view' allows you to view information by a given key.\n- 'set' allows you to add or update information by a given key.\n- 'delete' allows you to delete information by the specified key.\n\n##### Storage Management:\n--> deposit, withdrawal, and balance review\n\n- 'view-balance' allows you to view the storage balance for an account.\n- 'deposit' allows you to make a storage deposit for the account.\n- 'withdraw' allows you to make a withdraw a deposit from storage for an account ID.\n\n##### Permissions:\n--> giving access permissions to a different account\n\n- \"grant-write-access\" allows grant access to the access key to call a function or another account.\n\nMore commands are still on the way!\n\nSee the [issues tracker](https://github.com/FroVolod/bos-cli-rs/issues) and propose more features there.\n`;\n\nconst cssFont = fetch(\n  \"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Manrope:wght@200;300;400;500;600;700;800\"\n).body;\n\nif (!state.theme) {\n  State.update({\n    theme: styled.div`\n        font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif;\n        ${cssFont}\n        ${css}`,\n  });\n}\n\nconst Theme = state.theme;\n\nreturn (\n  <Theme>\n    <div\n      class=\"container pt-3 vw-80\"\n      style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ width: \"50vw\" }}>\n        <div style={{ padding: 32 }}>\n          <div className=\"mb-3\">\n            <h2 className=\"mb-2\">About BOS CLI</h2>\n            <a\n              className=\"btn btn-outline-success\"\n              href=\"https://github.com/bos-cli-rs/bos-cli-rs\"\n            >\n              Install via GitHub\n            </a>\n          </div>\n          <Markdown text={text} />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Theme>\n);\n", "metadata": null, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/hack.near/widget/docs.cli", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "0dc53d35ea3130172d2a1ec053bb0529", "inserted_timestamp": "2024-03-07T05:24:05.087Z", "modified_timestamp": "2024-03-07T05:24:05.087Z", "__row_index": 0}
