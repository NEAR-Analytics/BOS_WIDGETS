Patronizing the\n        Cooperative means you will provide a number of at least eight hours of\n        contribution to the Cooperative, by collaborating with projects,\n        participating in decisions about the membership class, certain\n        governance decisions, as provided for in the Bylaws of the Cooperative,\n        and other decisions put to a vote of the members, including concerning\n        retroactive compensation. The Cooperative may adopt other policies\n        specifying the activities that are considered patronage and you will\n        receive notice of those before being obligated to engage in such\n        activities.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Agree to be bound by Cooperative\u2019s Bylaws and the Articles, the Charter\n        and other policies of the Cooperative, and you are aware that you can\n        request a copy of the Bylaws.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Agree to keep all financial and proprietary information about the\n        Cooperative or its Members private and confidential, and not to use it\n        without permission even after termination of your membership.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p class=\"c1\">\n      <span class=\"c0\">\n        The Cooperative intends to operate equitably, creating opportunities for\n        the members to receive equitable distributions of benefits, and to\n        participate in decentralized decision-making. As part of this process,\n        we believe that we must reach a number of understandings, described\n        below:\n      </span>\n    </p>\n    <ul class=\"c6\">\n      <li class=\"c0\">\n        Understand that your membership is not transferable \u2013 so you cannot\n        transfer it to another person, but the Cooperative may agree to buy it\n        back from you. Your membership is also redeemable, which means that you\n        are entitled to reimbursement of the membership fee that you paid, if\n        any was paid, should you decide to no longer be a member in the\n        Cooperative.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the benefits of your membership can be modified by the\n        Council and management of the Cooperative at any time, without prior\n        notice; however, the Council may not eliminate your financial rights and\n        terminate your membership if you are a member in good standing. In case\n        of changes to your benefits, the Cooperative will make such information\n        available through its website, app, or another technology that gives you\n        proper notice, and you accept the use of the Cooperative\u2019s technology\n        for these purposes. Future potential financial distributions related to\n        your Cooperative membership cannot be taken away by the Council.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the Cooperative will engage in fair and decentralized\n        decision making, which means you will always have an opportunity to\n        share your perspective, feedback, and advice for decisions which impact\n        you. Additionally, the Cooperative will make major decisions, which\n        impact most members, through a combination of proposals and off and\n        on-chain voting, and the Member has the responsibility to work with the\n        proposers to improve the proposals.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the Cooperative will engage in fast and fair conflict\n        resolution, as provided by the policies of the Cooperative and the\n        Charter to find resolution.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that in case of dissolution of the Cooperative, or other\n        occasion for extraordinary dividends to be paid to Cooperative members,\n        you may be entitled to some financial distributions that could result in\n        a taxable event that you have a responsibility to claim on your tax\n        returns.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that, as a Cooperative Member, you have no authority to\n        represent the Cooperative in any way. For example, you cannot use the\n        name of the Cooperative to obtain credit, or enter into contracts on\n        behalf of the Cooperative.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the Cooperative may put a lien on your membership to\n        satisfy your financial obligations to the Cooperative; however, you may\n        not require that the Cooperative offset any debts or claims that you owe\n        to the Cooperative against any amounts that the Cooperative may owe to\n        you.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the Council and its representatives and the Admins have\n        the authority to enforce the terms of this Agreement.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Understand that the Cooperative\u2019s Council or a vote of the Members may\n        result in your termination if you fail to fulfil your obligations to the\n        Cooperative. You acknowledge that you have access to the Bylaws\n        describing the situations where this may happen and the procedure to be\n        followed.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <h5 class=\"c5\">\n      <span class=\"c0\">\n        <b>4.
