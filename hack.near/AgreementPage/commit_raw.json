Your membership is also redeemable, which means that\n          you are entitled to reimbursement of the membership fee that you paid,\n          if any was paid, should you decide to no longer be a member in the\n          Cooperative.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Understand that the benefits of your membership can be modified by the\n          Council and management of the Cooperative at any time, without prior\n          notice; however, the Council may not eliminate your financial rights\n          and terminate your membership if you are a member in good standing.
