After both players make their choice, the winner is determined according to the rules:\n\n- Rock crushes scissors (rock defeats scissors since they become blunt or break).\n- Scissors cut paper (scissors defeat paper as they can cut it).\n- Paper covers rock (paper defeats rock as it wraps around it).\n\nIf both players choose the same option, the game ends in a tie, and another round may be necessary. \"Rock, Paper, Scissors\" requires strategy, tactics, and even the ability to anticipate the opponent's choice, making it exciting and enjoyable for players of all ages.", "fork_of": "vlofoto81.near/widget/RockScissorsPaper@115174217"}, "branch": {"draft": null}, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/relayer.pagodaplatform.near/widget/RockScissorsPaper", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "d5e3d7b15c506654fe7d14d4b47b1644", "inserted_timestamp": "2024-03-21T19:25:58.961Z", "modified_timestamp": "2024-03-21T19:25:58.961Z", "__row_index": 0}
