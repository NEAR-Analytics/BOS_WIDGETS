The more books you add, the more they will get indexed onto the NEAR Chain, effectively migrating all book info onto the decentralized network eventually.\n\n## Feed\n\nThe feed will show you all the activity happening from who you are following. This will act like a timeline of sorts comparatively to other sorts of social networks.\n\n\n## Search\n\nSearch for books and add them to your collection. The added books will trigger a transaction call to add the book to the NEAR chain. This will only happen if the booked hasn't been indexed yet.\n\n\n## Future\n\nThis is not the end all state of this sort of application. This can be applied not only to books but other sources of interests like movies or comics.", "image": {"ipfs_cid": "bafkreidaeli2mxxnphqua2zbiwhfklv4vtpxsmyzjzf5pvo7pr32wz3atu"}, "name": "NEAR Books", "tags": {"books": "", "social": ""}}, "branch": null, "widget_modules_used": null, "widget_url": "https://near.social/#/chaotictempest.near/widget/NEARBooksMain", "fact_widget_deployments_id": "2c3a21233de18ae8fa7fc18bc3140633", "inserted_timestamp": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "modified_timestamp": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "__row_index": 4}
